# Introduction
Have you ever tried to start a new hobby, started to research it and found that it was just way too much information?

When it come to the fish keeping hobby, it can definitely become one of those situations. Between trying to find the exact temperature and water parameters needed to keep a fish happy and finding what creatures will actually get along, it can be a bit of a head scratcher. That is why I decided to begin development on the my EABA page!

With the Aquatic Environment Building Assistant, it will give you a simple to follow template that takes in your desired variables, which will then help you pick a fish species according to your needs. It cuts out the large quantity of research needed to find the desired info, and helps to guide you when setting up a new environment

# Technologies Used
This software uses the following programs:
- Express
- Node
- GraphQL
- MongoDB
- React

# Planned Future Developments
In the future, I hope to expand on my idea further with the following:
- An intergration with a shop front platform that incorporates the users variables and auto fills their cart for them
- Expanded options in the fish species pool
- Expanded connectivity with exact temperature brackets for more precise environment variables
- An addition of a builder assistant, which will provide tips to the users about their current choices, should the user require it
- A visual update to improve the aesthetic design of the builder
- A hazard matrix to measure the risk of certain combinations that, while viable, hold higher risk of failure
- Build guides / information posts for specific kinds of fish breeds, with integrations of other posts
